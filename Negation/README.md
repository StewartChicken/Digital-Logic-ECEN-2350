This verilog code will allow the boolean board to display a signed number based on the inputs of the first four switches on the board itself. The most significant
switch acts as the "signed" bit. The verilog will find the two's complement of the binary numbers if the most significant bit is a 1 which indicates 
that the number is negative.
